guideTest3
=======================

Neutrons go from outside the magnetic shielding room at x = 1.5 to x = 0,
where they get absorbed
The pipe has some inner diameter 0.0325, centered along x

The magnetic field is generated by COMSOL
B0_shielding_Room-2.mph. Inside the magnetic shielding is a pair of square
helmholtz coils. There is also a uniform background field in the x direction outside
the shielding
The pipe along which the neutrons are fed into the chamber
is also surrounded by a solenoid to maintain polarization

Isol0A - The solenoid is off
Lsol90cmIc8A - The solenoid is 90cm in length and has 8 A turns of current
Lsol100cmIc5A - The solenoid is 100cm in length and has 5 A turns of current
